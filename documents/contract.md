# CS 225 Data Structures

## Team Contract (rohitc2-ssohai20-adamjn3-nconner2)
 
### Communication:
1. **Team Meetings:** We will try to meet in the evening 3 times a week. Each meeting should last around 3 to 4 hours. We will be meeting in person, as we are all on campus. We will take notes and brainstorm ideas together.
2. **Assistance:** Since we are all on campus, we can just ask each other in person if we need help or opinions, and we can also text each other. Over text, we should be expected to respond within an hour or two. 
3. **Respect:** We will all take turns sharing our ideas and opinions; if someone is not getting a chance to speak, we will ask them what their thoughts are so we can make sure that everyone is getting a say. If someone has an idea, we will run it through everyone in the group before implementing it so we can ensure that everyone is on the same page.

### Collaboration:
1. **Work Distribution:** We will assign workload based on the tasks that we have for each portion of the project. We will deal with complications and unforeseen work by splitting it up and dealing with it as a team. We will distribute work in a way such that everyone is able to work on something that they enjoy to some extent.
2. **Time Commitment:** At least 5 hours per week is expected of each group member. We need to account for each other’s class schedules, club meetings, and meetings for other class projects, but overall we are all pretty flexible. When there are new conflicts or commitments, we will try to figure out a schedule that works for everyone in the group so we can make sure that everyone is contributing their fair share. 
3. **Conflict Resolution:** When there is a disagreement between members of the team, conflict will be solved by having a group discussion. When one or more members have not completed their tasks, we will talk to them and see why they haven’t completed their tasks. If one or members is continuously late, we will talk to them as a group and ask if they can start turning in assignments on time. I think we will be able to solve all problems in the group by ourselves without the need for course staff.
